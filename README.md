# Hi, I'm Yu Min! ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently more of a web developer, but I'm excited to explore new areas!  
- Currently comfortable with `Python`, `Go` and `Javascript`. 
- The most obscure language I know is [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
- I spend too much time tinkering around with my CLI and Neovim Configs ([dotfiles here ðŸ˜¬](https://github.com/notyumin/dotfiles)).  

### Personal Projects
- [CIS Youth Hymnal](https://github.com/church-sg/cis-youth-hymnal-v2) (`Hugo`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript`)
- [Scripts For Fun](https://github.com/notyumin/scripts-for-fun) (`Go`, `Python`)
